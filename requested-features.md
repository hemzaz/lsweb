# Requested Features for lsweb

This document lists potential new features for lsweb, ordered by implementation difficulty (easiest to hardest).

## Easy to Implement

2. **Output Filtering and Sorting**
   - Sort links by file size, type, or timestamp
   - Filter by file types (e.g., only `.pdf` or `.zip` files)
   - Option to only show links with direct downloads

3. **Download to Specific Directory**
   - Allow specifying output directory for downloads
   - Create directory structure if it doesn't exist
   - Preserve directory structure from URLs

4. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Multiple regex patterns with AND/OR logic
   - Content-type filtering
   - Size-based filtering before downloading

5. **Export/Import Capabilities**
   - Export link lists to various formats (CSV, Markdown)
   - Import URLs from text files
   - Generate shell scripts for downloading with other tools

## Moderate Difficulty

6. **Enhanced GitHub Integration**
   - Filter by specific GitHub release versions (latest, specific tag)
   - Better error handling for API rate limits
   - Include additional GitHub metadata (release notes, timestamps)

7. **Proxy Support**
   - Configure HTTP/SOCKS proxies
   - Rotate between multiple proxies for large downloads
   - Add proxy health checking

8. **Resume Interrupted Downloads**
   - Support for HTTP Range requests
   - Track partially downloaded files
   - Option to resume all interrupted downloads

9. **Basic Authentication Support**
   - Basic auth for accessing protected sites
   - Cookie-based auth with cookie jar storage
   - Command-line credential input

10. **Caching Mechanism**
    - Cache parsed URLs for faster repeat access
    - Store previous download lists for comparison
    - Cache HTTP responses with proper invalidation

## Hard to Implement

11. **Checksum Verification**
    - Automatically find and verify checksums when available
    - Support multiple hash algorithms (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
    - Generate checksums for downloaded files

12. **Content Processing**
    - Extract links from more formats (PDF, docx)
    - Recursive crawling with depth control
    - Extract metadata like titles along with links

13. **Web Interface**
    - Simple local web UI for interactive use
    - Real-time progress visualization
    - Drag-and-drop file selection
    - Mobile-friendly design

14. **Performance Improvements**
    - Distributed downloading across machines
    - Smart throttling to avoid overwhelming servers
    - Streaming content processing for large files

15. **Integration with Other Tools**
    - Webhooks to notify on completion
    - JSON API for programmatic access
    - Plugin system for custom link extraction

## Hard to Implement (continued)

16. **Daemon Mode**
    - Run lsweb as a background service/daemon
    - Auto-start capability on system boot
    - Logging and rotation system for long-running instances
    - Graceful shutdown and restart capabilities

17. **Client-Daemon Communication**
    - File/directory polling interface for job submission
    - Unix socket communication protocol
    - TCP/IP interface with optional TLS
    - Command-line client to interact with daemon

## Very Challenging

    - Support for various OAuth providers
    - Token management and refresh
    - Secure credential storage

19. **Advanced Download Management**
    - Priority-based download queue
    - Bandwidth scheduling and throttling
    - Smart retry with exponential backoff

20. **Plugin System**
    - Extensible architecture for custom site handlers
    - Developer documentation for plugins
    - Plugin marketplace or registry

21. **Advanced Daemon Features**
